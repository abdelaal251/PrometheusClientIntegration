# Prometheus Integration Django Project

This project, `PrometheusIntegration`, is a Django application that demonstrates how to integrate Prometheus for monitoring and exposing metrics. It includes a simple API endpoint (`/api/hello/`) that accepts various types of data (JSON, text, files, and empty requests) and responds with a "Hello World" message. The application also exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) that can be scraped by a Prometheus server for monitoring purposes.

## Features

- **API Endpoint**: `/api/hello/` - Accepts POST requests with JSON, text, files, or empty data and returns a "Hello World" message.
- **Prometheus Metrics**: `/metrics` - Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring.

- Django 5.1.1
- PostgreSQL (for database backend)
- Prometheus server for scraping metrics
